# React.js Learning Repository

Welcome to my **React.js Learning Repository**!  

This is where I document and implement everything I learn while going through the [official documentation](https://react.dev/).  

The goal of this repo is to **solidify my understanding** by writing code, organizing by topics, and maintaining clear, concise notes.

## Repository Structure

Each major topic from the React docs is separated into its own **directory**. Inside each directory, you’ll typically find:

- `index.jsx` / `App.jsx`: The main code implementation for that topic.

- `notes.md`: A Markdown file containing written notes, explanations, and personal observations.

- `assets/`: (Optional) Any images, references, or supporting files.

## Notes and Documentation

For every topic, there’s a corresponding `README.md` file where I write:

- Key concepts and definitions

- Code walk-throughs

- Insights from the docs and external tutorials

- Common pitfalls and errors

- Links to official docs, videos, and Stack Overflow threads

These notes act as my second brain and reference for revision.
